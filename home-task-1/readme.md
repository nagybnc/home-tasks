Consult the following binary search tree implementation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-binary-search-tree-javascript/

Use design patterns for the implementation (eg. Composite, Strategy, Visitor).
Implement sortByName and sortBySalary methods and implement performace measuring/logging.Compare the performances of different tree implementations.

The initial dataset will be provided.
